# Fungal-ID-Playlist
Create a Living "Fungal ID Playlist" Build a shared digital collection (Google Slides, Padlet, or class wiki) where students contribute: * High-quality images of specimens they've identified * Key diagnostic features annotated on photos * Mnemonics or memory tricks they've developed * Common identification mistakes and how to avoid them
